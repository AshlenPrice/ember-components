# Ember Components

Components are used to encapsulate (repetitious) markup and tie it behavior.
Instead of separating our concerns along technological lines (HTML, CSS, JS),
components tie all three of these technologies together under a reified visual
element in the user interface.

## Prerequisites

-   Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
-   Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
    Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
-   [Links to previous materials](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/example)
    are often useful.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Model the user interface using components
-   Represent visual hierarchies with nested components
-   Register actions and click handlers on component objects
-   Pass data from routes to components, and from components to components

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.

## Follow-Along: Wireframe the Listr Interface

Wireframe the [Listr client](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/listr-client)
application interface.

## Code-Along: Create a List Component

## Lab: Create a List Item Component

## Code-Along: Toggle Display of a List

Toggle display of list on header click.

## Lab: Toggle Strike-Through of a List Item

Toggle strike-through of list item on item click.
